Hi! I'm Yifei Huang (ÈªÑÈÄ∏È£û), a Project Assistant Professor (Áâπ‰ªªÂä©Êïô) in [Sato Laboratory](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), which is in the [Institute of Industrial Science](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) of the [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I am now working with [Prof. Yoichi Sato](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ysato/index.html) under the [JST CREST](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~cvs/) project, which focuses on understanding and assistance of egocentric activities using first-person cues.

I received my PhD and M.S. from the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), supervised by Prof. Yoichi Sato, under the support of the [Global Creative Leader](http://www.gcl.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) program of the University of Tokyo. I received my B.S. in Automation in [IEEE honor class](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).


My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published 20+ papers at the top international AI conferences. See my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RU8gNcgAAAAJ'> Google Scholar </a> for a more complete list.
